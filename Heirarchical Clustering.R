## Hierarchical Clustering
## find 2 closest points and mergem them into a "super point"  
## find next two closest points in new dataset and merge them
## repeat

## Initially we must decide what we mean by "close"
## Traditionally we use euclidian distances




## can use binary ditance (Manhattan)
## Think city block and grid systems
## In some cases this more accurately represents the distance between two points
